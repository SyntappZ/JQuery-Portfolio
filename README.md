# JQuery-Portfolio

This is my first project using jquery and now i realise why its so popular it makes the animating the web page so much easier and saves writing a lot of code, making this page i learnt a lot more about using parameters in functions, i learnt a lot about how to animate in jquery with the animate function and the css function, i also learnt about the append function which i used to add paragraph tags on click then used remove function to remove. 
this page has been a lot of fun to make and i plan to use more jquery in the future.
